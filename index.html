	<p>
	Hi, welcome to my website. As you can see my site is fairly empty at the moment. 
	This is a side project I have undertaken in my spare time to further my experience
	and learning of HTML basics.
	</p> 

	<div>
	For the time being, as this site further develops and
	more information is added, I urge you to take a look at my <a href="https://github.com/snow942">GitHub</a>,
	my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m1Txe2rJoQQSU6kOxvEUwROsMQUPnl0-/view?usp=sharing">CV</a>,
	or to <a href = "mailto: snow4964@gmail.com">email me</a> (at snow4964@gmail.com).
