		<p>Hi, welcome to my website. As you can see my site is fairly empty at the moment. 
		This is a side project I have undertaken in my spare time to further my learning of HTML basics.
			<br />
			<br />
		For the time being, as this site further develops and as
		more information is added, I urge you to take a look at my 
		<a href="https://github.com/snow942" target="_blank">GitHub</a>,
		my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GTGcPM1Epe0jf9HP9iB0q0SylT6Vp2N-/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">CV</a>,
		or to <a href = "mailto: snow4964@gmail.com">email me</a> (at snow4964@gmail.com).
